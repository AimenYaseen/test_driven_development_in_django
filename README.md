# test_driven_development_in_django
This project will contain functional tests and unit tests. Its main focus will be unit tests. I will practice 'how to write unit tests and then write functions to pass that tests'.

Steps to follow:
- clone the repository
- create a virtual environment
- install requirements using command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- To run functional tests, you need selenium. To run selenium, you need a web driver. It can be geckodriver(firefox) or chromedriver(google chrome).
- Download them using these links
- geckodriver - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
- chromedriver - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- use the latest or the one that matches your browser versions.
- extract and then move the executable file to your projects virtual environments bin directory.
